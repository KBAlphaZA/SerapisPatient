#Test Case

# [TC-ID] : Title of the test

## Description

The description should tell the tester what they’re going to test and include any other pertinent information such as the test environment, test data, and preconditions/assumptions.

### Precondition

Any preconditions that must be met prior to the test being executed.

### Assumptions

Any assumptions that apply to the test

## Test Steps

The test steps should include the data and information on how to execute the test.  

This is perhaps the most important part of a test case. 

Keep this section clear and concise (a list would be fine), but don’t leave out any necessary details.

## Expected Result

The expected result tells the tester what they should experience as a result of the test steps.

This is how the tester determines if the test case is a “pass” or “fail”.
